The design of this system is to help the ease of access for employees to interact with customers. In this system, it is designed to aid the developer and the manager in retrieving information about any known license and vulnerabilty found in the software pacakage. The purpose of this system is to allow the developer and the manager an easier way to access the information with just a push of a button instead of having to find the information through manual means. This allows for more accurate and faster production. 

In this system, when the developer sends a request to scan his software package for any existing license and vulnerability, the system scans the package against the NIST Vulnerability Database and FOSSology for any known vulnerability or license that he should be cautious of as he works on his software pacakage. As the system scans the package for any license or vulnerability, it also stores the information into the company's own Software Package License and Vulnerability Information Database which can be accessed by the manager when needed. Besides that, the company also has a Project Policy For Licenses and Vulnerabilties Database where the developer or the manager can request the project policy so that they know what is required by the company. The manager is also able to request the database to update or modify the current project policy.
