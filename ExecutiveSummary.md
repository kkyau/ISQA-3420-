The design of this system is to help the ease of access for employees to interact with customers. For example, in this assignment, the system is designed to aid the developer to scan his software package for licenses and vulnerabilities. The system is also designed to help the manager check the software package for any vulnerabilities and licenses as well as to allow the manager to update and modify any required policies in the data store. 

In this system, when the developer sends a request to scan his software package for any existing licenses and vulnerabilities, the system scans the package against the NIST Vulnerability Database and the FOSSology Database for any vulnerabilities or licenses that he should be cautious of as he works on his software pacakage. As the system scans the package for any license or vulnerabilities, it also stores the information into the company's own Software Package License and Vulnerability Information which can be accessed by the manager when needed. 

Before releasing the package to the outside world, a manager or a developer can also submit a project request where the request is set against an open source policy document to highlight software pacakages that will violate licenses or vulnerability requirements which might cause problems in the future with legal rights or any software issues. In this system, the manager is also allowed to update or modify any existing policies in the datastore that they see fit.
