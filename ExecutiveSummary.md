The design of this system is to help the ease of access for employees to interact with customers. For example, in this assignment, the system is designed to aid the developer to scan his software package for licenses and vulnerabilities. The system is also designed to help the manager check the software package for any vulnerabilities and licenses as well as to allow the manager to update and modify any required policies in the data store. 

In this system, when the developer sends a request to scan his software package for any existing license and vulnerability, the system scans the package against the NIST Vulnerability Database and FOSSology for any known vulnerability or license that he should be cautious of as he works on his software pacakage. As the system scans the package for any license or vulnerability, it also stores the information into the company's own Software Package License and Vulnerability Information Database which can be accessed by the manager when needed. Besides that, the company also has a Project Policy For Licenses and Vulnerabilties Database where the developer or the manager can request the project policy so that they know what is required by the company. The manager is also able to request the database to update or modify the current project policy.
